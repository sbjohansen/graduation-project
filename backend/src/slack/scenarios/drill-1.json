  "scenarioTitle": "Suspicious Email Reports",
  "scenarioDescription": "Employees are reporting potentially malicious emails. Your job is to lead the incident response team to investigate the threat, contain the impact, and implement protective measures.",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "length": "Short",
  "initialSituation": "John (Security Analyst) receives a forwarded email from an employee marked 'Suspicious - urgent look needed?'. The email appears to be from IT asking the user to click a link to verify their account due to recent 'unusual activity'. Shortly after, another similar report arrives from a different department, mentioning an attachment.",
  "overallGoal": "Analyze the reported suspicious emails to confirm they are part of a phishing campaign. Identify the threat vector (malicious link/attachment, credential harvesting). Determine the scope (users affected). Warn employees. Implement technical mitigations (e.g., block sender/domain, flag external emails, analyze payload safely, update filters). Investigate and contain potential impact (check for compromised accounts/systems). Confirm threat containment and provide final guidance. Ensure the team lead (user) makes key decisions.",
