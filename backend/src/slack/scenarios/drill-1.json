  "scenarioTitle": "Suspicious Email Reports",
  "scenarioDescription": "Employees are reporting potentially malicious emails. Your job is to lead the incident response team to investigate the threat, contain the impact, and implement protective measures.",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "length": "Short",
  "initialSituation": "John (Security Analyst) receives a forwarded email from an employee marked 'Suspicious - urgent look needed?'. The email appears to be from IT asking the user to click a link to verify their account due to recent 'unusual activity'. Shortly after, another similar report arrives from a different department, mentioning an attachment.",
  "overallGoal": "Guide the incident manager through a methodical phishing investigation. The incident manager should: (1) Assign John to analyze the suspicious emails to confirm they are phishing, (2) Have team identify threat vectors (malicious link/attachment, credential harvesting), (3) Determine scope by checking for affected users, (4) Direct implementation of technical mitigations (block sender/domain, update filters, analyze payloads safely), (5) Investigate potential impact (compromised accounts/systems), (6) Ensure proper containment and provide final guidance. Bots should wait for instructions, ask clarifying questions, and suggest next steps only when the incident manager appears stuck.",
