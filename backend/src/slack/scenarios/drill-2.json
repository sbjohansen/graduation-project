  "scenarioDescription": "A major product launch faces unexpected cybersecurity challenges. Your job is to lead the incident response with your team of bots.",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "length": "Medium",
  "initialSituation": "It's launch day for 'Pete's Big Day 2.0'. Initial signs are good, but suddenly the site becomes extremely slow. Monitoring shows a massive, unexpected spike in traffic directed primarily at the login and checkout APIs. Customers are complaining of timeouts and failed checkouts.",
  "overallGoal": "Guide the incident manager through DDoS attack response. The incident manager should: (1) Direct technical team to investigate the traffic anomaly and identify it as a DDoS attack, (2) Coordinate implementation of mitigation techniques (IP blocking, rate limiting, WAF rules), (3) Monitor effectiveness and direct adjustments, (4) Ensure legitimate traffic can still reach the site, (5) Confirm performance restoration and business continuity. Bots should provide status updates when asked, suggest mitigation strategies when the incident manager requests guidance, and wait for explicit instructions before taking action.",
