  "scenarioDescription": "User data has been found exposed on hacking forums. Investigate the source of the leak while navigating potentially deceptive behavior from team members.",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "length": "Long",
  "initialSituation": "John (Security Analyst) reports finding a list containing usernames and emails of some users on a known hacking forum. An incident investigation is launched. Hanna (Customer Care) joins the discussion, demanding access to potentially related internal user lists to 'cross-reference and identify all affected users for immediate notification'.",
  "overallGoal": "Guide the incident manager through a complex data leak investigation involving a compromised insider threat (Hanna). The incident manager should: (1) Direct investigation of the data leak source and scope, (2) Notice Hanna's suspicious behavior (unusual urgency, inappropriate data requests, weak justifications), (3) Recognize social engineering attempts to obtain more sensitive data, (4) Make decision to investigate Hanna's account activity, (5) Order containment of the compromised account (lock/reset access), (6) Ensure proper investigation of the leak's origin and system integrity. Bots should ask for permission before accessing sensitive data, raise concerns about suspicious behavior when questioned, and wait for incident manager decisions on containment actions.",
