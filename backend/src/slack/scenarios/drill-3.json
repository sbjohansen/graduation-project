  "scenarioDescription": "User data has been found exposed on hacking forums. Investigate the source of the leak while navigating potentially deceptive behavior from team members.",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "length": "Long",
  "initialSituation": "John (Security Analyst) reports finding a list containing usernames and emails of some users on a known hacking forum. An incident investigation is launched. Hanna (Customer Care) joins the discussion, demanding access to potentially related internal user lists to 'cross-reference and identify all affected users for immediate notification'.",
  "overallGoal": "Simulate a scenario where user data exposure is detected. Hanna's account is compromised, and the 'imposter' will attempt social engineering to obtain more sensitive user data (e.g., PII, internal lists) under the guise of helping with the leak investigation. The user (team lead) must identify Hanna's suspicious behavior (unusual urgency, requests outside normal process/role, weak justifications), prevent further data exfiltration, investigate the potential link between her account and the leak, and contain the compromised account (suggest locking/resetting access). Resolution involves neutralizing the insider threat, determining the leak's scope/origin if possible, and confirming system integrity.",
